See Luis, comments and suggestions below.

Luis
    I have updated parallel.py to reflect your suggestion.   Specifically I have tagged the import results so the queue items can be identified.
    The file results_with_tags.txt are the result of the rerun.

Thanks
Mike

+    thread1.start()
+    thread2.start()
+
+    thread1.join()
+    thread2.join()
+
+    end_time = time.time()
+
+    thread1_result = output_queue.get()
This is only true if thread1 is the first to push data into output_queue. In the (very possible) scenario that thread2 puts its data into the queue first, thread1_result will really contain the results from thread2.

Try to add a marker or something else that allows you to identify whose data you're pulling from the queue.
