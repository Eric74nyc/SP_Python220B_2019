Design and Test Notes

. Expanded data files to 1000 records
. Created linear source from lesson 5 source
. Created parallel source from linear as base
. Updated linear and parallel imports for Products and Customers
. Updated parallel to run imports Products and Customers in parallel
. DesignDetails - Parallel introduces threads, therefore Products and Customer imports run on their own thread.
. DesignDetails - Parallel uses the queue class is a blocking class queue.get/put calls for thread synchronization
. Update linear and parallel to report import results (see results.txt files) (see format below)
. Update linear and parallel to report runtimes (see results.txt files) (see format below)
. Performance - on average liner executes in 1.9sec and parallel executes in 1.1 secs.
. Performance - on average parallel shows approx 45% efficiency gain, so running on 2 threads improves performance.
. Format - Process results format (see results.txt) (ImportedCount, StartingDbCount, EndingDbCount, ImportExecutionTime, ErrorsCount)
